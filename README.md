**A YAML-powered Python project to interface with C4D / Blensor to simulate the deployment of CubeSats from a NanoRacks ISS deployer.**

*This repository is the home for the VANTAGE Simulation project, which is a component of the larger [VANTAGE (2018-19) project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SbkY5wjO9he67aB8XnaSnfTiQf65CChv?usp=sharing) at the [CU Boulder Ann and H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/). Our project is sponsored by a collaboration between [CCAR](https://www.colorado.edu/ccar/) and [NanoRacks](http://nanoracks.com/). You can find more of the software developed for the VANTAGE project on the [VANTAGE organization page](https://github.com/vantagecu).*

## About this Repo

This repo contains the models, documentation, and code necessary to simulate any VANTAGE use-case CubeSat deployment using both monochrome and ToF sensing.

We use [Cinema 4D R20 (C4D)](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/products/cinema-4d/overview/) to simulate our monochrome camera's properties and [Blensor](https://www.blensor.org/) to simulate our ToF flight sensor.

The important directories contained in this repo are:

* `config`: this dir contains the YAML configuration files used to completely automate the creation of a C4D animation case.

* `3d_assets`: this dir contains the 3D deployer model as well as the 3D cubesat models used in the simulation.

* `docs`: the homeland for wild simulation documentation. There are videos in here showing visualizations from both C4D and Blensor simulation of the same deployment, and actual ISS CubeSat deployment footage from [NanoRacks](http://nanoracks.com/), among other useful things.

## Directory Structure

The following directory structure shows the directory structure if you run the full simulation framework with a configuration file named: `configName = SPS_template.yaml`. The `runC4D.py` code will automatically build a "case" directory from this config file, named with the following convention `configName + '-' + '%H_%M_%S_%Y_%m_%d'`.

## Simulation Parameterization / Geometry Definition

The definition of deployer variables used in the parameterization and case creation can be found in (shown below):

`<VANTAGE_SIMULATION>\docs\deployer_VANTAGE_geometry_and_coordinate_frame_defs.pdf`

The `docs` directory contains a lot of the relevant information used in the process of creating and validating the simulation.

### Description of Simulation Parameters

We have heavily scripted the creation of a C4D simulation case. Currently, the entire simulation is automated with the following being some major *settings you can change*:

* which deployment tube you are launching out of

* where the global coordinate system is centered - originally set to the center of tube 1 (11/5)

* the sequence and size of CubeSats that will be deployed

* The Optical / ToF camera parameters

* the motion of each individual CubeSat (linear and rotational velocities of each CubeSat centroid)

**WARNING**: we do not currently check for collision, so make sure you don't prescribe motion that will cause the CubeSats collide

*The description of what each parameter is should be evident in the location you set it, whether it be in the YAML config, or in the source itself.*

### How to Set the Simulation Parameters

**I would highly recommend using a text editor which supports YAML syntax highlighting - it will make editing the config file much less error prone and easier to read.**

In order to change these settings, make a copy of:
`<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/config/config_simulation_template.yaml`
in the `<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/config/` directory.

**USE `config_simulation_template.yaml` as your starter config NOT `SPS_template.yaml`**
*(I'm sorry I accidentally built this whole example with the `SPS_template` for some dumb reason and I'm scared to change it)*

Rename your new config file with a meaningful name, following a reasonable config naming convention.

Edit the config file variables as you see fit to create the correct C4D case. Make sure to visually inspect the case before you run a lengthy simulation.

**As I ran out of time, some of the ToF camera simulation parameters must be adjusted in runBlensor.py itself.**

#### Simulation Path Setting
***Make sure to set the path `SIM_DIR_LOCATION` in the YAML config file to be the full path string to wherever you cloned the `VANTAGE_Simulation` directory.***

e.g. you cloned `VANTAGE_Simulation` to your desktop: `/Users/<USERNAME>/Desktop`. Then, you should set the `SIM_DIR_LOCATION` key in the config file to be:
```yaml
---

SIM_DIR_LOCATION: '/Users/<USERNAME>/Desktop/VANTAGE_Simulation'
```

If you encounter an error like:
`TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable`
while doing operations on objects, it likely means that you have set this path incorrectly and the simulation cannot find the 3d object files in `<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/3s_assets/`.

## Simulation Output Directory -- `4_Simulation_Cases`

Each time you run a simulation case in C4D and then in Blensor (the methodology for doing so is shown in [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) and [How to Render with C4D](#how-to-render-with-c4d) and [How to Run a Blensor Simulation](#how-to-run-a-blensor-simulation), an output "Case Directory" (an example case directory is shown throughout this document as `./4_Simulation_Cases/SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19`) is created corresponding to the name and current time of the configuration file specified in `currSimConfigFile` (see [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) for more details on configuration).

This directory will contain the following files, as seen in the "Directory Structure" section of this document:

```

For the next description, I will generalize the specific string associated with the example case directory name - `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19`) - as `<CASE_DIR_NAME>` (e.g. `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19` <==> `<CASE_DIR_NAME>`). `<CASE_DIR_NAME>` refers to *any and all* case directory names generated during the simulation process.

`<CASE_DIR_NAME_LITE>` refers to the case directory name without the date string appended to it (e.g. `<CASE_DIR_NAME> = 'SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19'`, `<CASE_DIR_NAME_LITE> = 'SPS_template'`)

A detailed description of the major case directory (`<CASE_DIR_NAME>`) components are as follows:

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/ToF_Data`: This directory contains pointcloud (`*.pcd`) data from the Blensor Simulation. Each "Sample" directory contains a full set of pointclouds generated from simulated noisy ToF scans over a simulated CubeSat deployment. The reason for having multiple scans is to have multiple full scans of the same deployment, each with different random noise, to test the robustness of our pointcloud processing algorithms against sensor noise. *This directory is only populated if you manually elect to produce ToF pointcloud in Blensor -- see [How to Run a Blensor Simulation](#how-to-run-a-blensor-simulation) for details*

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/Optical_Data`: This directory contains ray-traced renders (`*.png`) from the simulated VANTAGE monochrome camera generated by a C4D render. These simulated images have been calibrated and tested to be representative of images taken by the real monochrome camera we employ (see `*/docs/side_by_side_comparison.png`) *This directory is only populated if you manually elect to produce rendered images with C4D -- see [How to Render with C4D](#how-to-render-with-c4d) for details*

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/<CASE_DIR_NAME>.blend`: This is the blender file containing the full deployment animation and the full ToF simulation state after it has run. This is an optional, but recommended file to save so you can go back later and see exactly what ToF parameters were used. *see [How to Run a Blensor Simulation](#how-to-run-a-blensor-simulation)for details*

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/<CASE_DIR_NAME>.c4d`: This is the C4D file containing the C4D scenario with all objects, cameras, and C4D render settings. Saving this file is suggested to the user after the C4D simulation creation process. *see [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) for details*

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/<CASE_DIR_NAME>.fbx`: This filetype (`.fbx`) is a generic 3D file format that will contain all 3D objects, their animations, and their parameters (including the camera parameters). This file is created in C4D and then imported into Blensor to load in the same deployment scenario. Saving this file is suggested to the user after the C4D simulation creation process. *see [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) and [How to Run a Blensor Simulation](#how-to-run-a-blensor-simulation for details)*

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/<CASE_DIR_NAME_LITE>_truth_data.json`: This file, in the JSON data serialization format (please, please dear god use something like this (e.g. YAML, JSON, XML, etc.) *for all* file I/O) contains all of the actual 3D positions of each CubeSat's centroid in VCF ([cm]) at each time step ([s]). The JSON schema for the truth data is *roughly* this (below generated for `./4_Simulation_Cases/SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19/SPS_template_truth_data.json`):
```json

* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/<CASE_DIR_NAME_LITE>.yaml`: This file contains the YAML configuration file that you specify in `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/currSimConfigFile` (see [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) for more details), which controls *almost* all of the simulation parameters (see [How to Run a Blensor Simulation](#how-to-run-a-blensor-simulation for details) on what parameters must be set outside the YAML config file). It is automatically copied to `<CASE_DIR_NAME>` during the C4D simulation setup so you know *exactly* what settings were used to create each simulation (for audibility).

## How to Run a C4D Simulation

### `runC4D.py`

![Alt](docs/assets/usingC4D.PNG "usingC4D")

1) Open C4D (you can get an educational license from the Maxon website - see `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/docs/0 HowToGetCinema4d` for more detailed info)

2) Open the script manager (Script -> Script Manager) and the console (Script -> Console)

3) From the script manager, open `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/runC4D.py`

3.5) **If running everything for the first time, you will need to get the 'pyyaml' package on the c4d python path.**

* in the python script console (see image above) do the following:
```python
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.path)
```

* now, unzip the contents of `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/site-packages.zip` and place them in a directory listed in the `print(sys.path)` call.

If on macOS, the directory to put the unzipped `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/site-packages.zip` could be:
`/Applications/MAXON/Cinema 4D R20 Education/resource/modules/python/libs/osx/python27.framework/lib/python2.7`

If on windows, the directory to put the unzipped `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/site-packages.zip` could be:
`C:\Program Files\MAXON\Cinema 4D R20 Education\resource\modules\python\libs\win64\python27.vs2008.framework\lib`

* you should now have the ability to `import yaml` and `import pip` from the c4d python script console.

* if you need to install more packages to the c4d python distribution (like `numpy`), now you can simply do (from the c4d python script console):

```python
>>> import pip
>>> pip.main(['install', 'numpy'])
>>> import numpy
```

4) Edit `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/currSimConfigFile` with the name of the config file you would like to run the simulation with (e.g. `SPS_template` to use `SPS_template.yaml` as your input config file).

5) Click the **Execute** button in the C4D Script Manager

6) The simulation will load everything in and set all necessary settings.

7) A window will pop up asking you to save the c4d file. Navigate to the "case" directory (see the directory structure section for more details) created for the config file you typed in `currSimConfigFile`.

8) At this point you get to name the .c4d file. **Recommended file name:** Copy the name of the case directory (e.g. `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19`), paste this name into the text field, then append `.c4d` to this name (e.g. `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19.c4d`).

9) Now you will be asked to name the FBX output (animation / camera data) of the simulation. It is again recommended to use the case dir name + `.fbx` as the fbx output filename (e.g. `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19.fbx`).

10) If you would like to actually generate representative images from the camera, you will need to **render** the camera's perspective of the deployment. See the [How to Render with C4D](#how-to-render-with-c4d) section for details.

## How to Render with C4D

![Alt](docs/assets/usingC4DRender.PNG "usingC4DRender")

1) After you have completed all steps in [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation), you must now edit the render settings. Go to Render -> Edit Render Settings...

2) In the Render settings, make sure to select the **ProRender** setting. You may have to toggle between render engines before ProRender activates.
You must use the ProRender engine to properly render everything. In R20.028, there is a bug that prevents automated choice of render engine. MAKE SURE that the ProRender menu is properly set!

3) In the ProRender settings, make sure you turn ON **Depth of Field**. All other render settings should be automatically set by the python module. Close the render settings menu.

4) To start a queue of renders, go to Render -> Render Queue.

![Alt](docs/assets/usingC4DRenderQueue.PNG "usingC4DRenderQueue")

5) "Open" the `.c4d` file in the case directory you would like to render (e.g. `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19.c4d`)

6) Click the three dots on the right of the "output file" text field to select the output image file location and naming convention.

7) Navigate to the case directory for the `.c4d` file you are rendering, then navigate to the `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CASE_DIR_NAME>/Optical_Data/` directory (e.g. `./4_Simulation_Cases/SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19/Optical_Data/`).

8) Copy the case directory name (e.g. `SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19`) into the "File Name" field.

9) Click "Start Render" and watch your CPU and GPU melt for an hour. :)

## How to Run a Blensor Simulation
### `runBlensor.py`

![Alt](docs/assets/usingBlensor.PNG "usingBlensor")

To begin this section, **you must have completed all steps in [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) first.** C4D is used for the simulation animation building, so you must have the .fbx file output to begin the Blensor simulation process.

1) Start by opening `runBlensor.py` in your favorite text editor -- I prefer using desktop sticky notes.

2) Next, open up [Blensor](https://www.blensor.org/). If you have access to the VANTAGE drive, you will need my modified version of Blensor from the simulation directory, or some of this won't work. :(

3) File -> Import -> .fbx

4) Navigate to the desired simulation case directory and select the .fbx you created in [How to Run a C4D Simulation](#how-to-run-a-c4d-simulation) (e.g. `./4_Simulation_Cases/SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19/SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19.fbx`) and *double* click the file to import it.

5) Watch a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w) while it loads in.

6) In the "Data Outliner" sub-menu, select *ONLY* the "Camera" Object.

7) Determine how many frames it takes in the simulation for the closest CubeSat to reach its desired distance away from the deployer.

8) Enter this number as `MAX_FRAMES` in `runBlensor.py`. This will make the simulation take a ToF scan every frame from frame 1 to frame `MAX_FRAMES`.

9) Next, in `runBlensor.py`, set `NUM_SIMS_TO_RUN`. This will run the whole stochastic simulation `NUM_SIMS_TO_RUN` times. See "Directory Structure" for how each "Sample" of the sensor simulation over the range frame is stored in the case directory. You will end up with `NUM_SIMS_TO_RUN` independent sets of noisy sensor data over the scan range defined in the `MAX_FRAMES` setting step.

10) Now, set the `outputCase` variable in `runBlensor.py` to be the name of the case directory you loaded in as an .fbx previously (e.g. `outputCase = 'SPS_template-09_13_17_2019_04_19'`).

11) Now, go back to Blensor. Open the region editor "Text Editor" in Blensor, and open `./<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/runBlensor.py`.

12) Again, in the "Data Outliner" region editor, ensure you have selected *ONLY* the "Camera" Object.

13) In a different region, open the Scripting "Info" editor. Once this is open, you'll want to go to Window -> Toggle System Console.

14) **NOW you're ready to run!** yay. In the text Editor region editor, click "Run Script".

15) Watch gigabytes of data slowly appear in your case directory ToF_Data directory

16) The only way to tell when the simulation is fully done is to watch the System Console output you just opened, as Blensor uses a threaded dispatch system without any locking implementation. Once the System Console no longer reports output, you will need to clear up the output directories.

***USE THE FOLLOWING AT YOUR OWN RISK***
*The following can be done more safely manually if you don't trust my file deletion regex or the absolute paths supplied.*

These steps should only be done once you are happy with your simulations and are ready to begin using the data for testing VANTAGE software.

17) Open `*/<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/cleanCaseToFDirs.py` in your favorite sticky note based text editor. Edit `outputDir` to be the correct absolute path to the `4_Simulation_Cases` directory.

18) Navigate to `*/<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/` from powershell / terminal and then run `*/<VANTAGE_SIMULATION_LOCATION>/cleanCaseToFDirs.py`. This removes all of the non-noisy ToF `.pcd` files from **ALL** `./4_Simulation_Cases/<ANY_CASE_NAME>/ToF_Data` directories.

19) You will have to manually remove more files manually from each "Sample" directory in ToF_Data:
* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CURRENT_CASE_NAME>/ToF_Data/Sample<XXX>/Sample<XXX>_<CURRENT_CASE_NAME>`
* `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CURRENT_CASE_NAME>/ToF_Data/Sample<XXX>/Sample<XXX>_<CURRENT_CASE_NAME>.pcd`

20) Save the current scence as a `.blend` file in the case directory (e.g. `./4_Simulation_Cases/<CURRENT_CASE_NAME>/<CURRENT_CASE_NAME>.blend`)

21) Congrats on simulating a ToF Camera!
